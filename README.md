# 3-D seismic interpretation with deep learning: a set of Python tutorials

![alt text](https://github.com/thilowrona/seismic_deep_learning/blob/master/image.png)

Here we are sharing our code, tutorials and examples used to interpret geological structures (e.g. faults, salt bodies and horizones) in 2-D and/or 3-D seismic reflection data using deep learning. The repository is organised in a series of tutorials (Jupyter notebooks) with increasing degree of difficulty. We show step-by-step how to: (1) load seismic data, (2) train a model and (3) apply the model to map different geological structures. You can find a few visual examples on our [poster](https://www.thilowrona.com/posters) and more technical details in our [preprint](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/1683/).

To get started, you don't need any special hardware, software, data or experience - just a bit of time.
